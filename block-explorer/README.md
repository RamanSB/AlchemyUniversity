### Etherscan Clone

#### About

This repository is my attempt to solve [Alchemy University's Ethereum Bootcamp Week 3 Challenge](https://university.alchemy.com/course/ethereum/md/63f8fb47716397000257645a).

I am attempting to recreate Etherscan, the purpose of this exercise to gain competency (the ability) & proficiency (familiarity) with using the ethers library,
specifically the Json(RpcProvider) to make JSON-RPC requests to read data from the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Features

- [x] Ability to query by Transaction hash.
- [x] Ability to query by Block number.
- [] Ability to query by EOA
- [] Perform Pagination on the Transaction List returned by querying the etherscan API.
- [] Add logic to ensure Transaction page fetches data and updates searchResults if searchResults are new.
- [] Add demo Gif to README.md
